## Section 1: Project Description

<p> 
This code allows a user to compare a movie blurb with a series of movie blurbs saved in a .txt file and calculate the semantic similarities between the movies.
It will also recommend the movie the user should watch based on the input blurb
<p>

## Section 2: Installation Section

<p> 
This programme contains a file movies.txt and a file watch_next.py. You will also need to install spacy, the nlp package, instructions for which can be found here:

<p>

## Section 3: Usage Section

<p>
This programme contains a file movies.txt where each line represents a movie and is of the format "movie name" : "movie blurb". The ":" is used by the code to separate these. It also contains a file movies watch_next which takes as input a string containing the blurb of the movie you have just watched. It will then print out a list of movies in movie.txt accompanied by the similarity to your movie. It will also recommend the next movie you should watch based on the maximum semantic similarity.
